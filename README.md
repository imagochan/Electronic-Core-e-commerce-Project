# Electronic Core Web Project
Electronic Core is a web-based e-commerce platform demo, designed for buying and selling electronic products online. Developed collaboratively using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB Atlas, the system provides a shopping experience with  product listings, user-friendly navigation, and backend integration.

The platform’s architecture separates concerns into models, controllers, routes, and views, ensuring scalability and maintainability. Deployment is handled via Heroku, while project management and task coordination are tracked through Trello.

## Key features include:

- Product management: Browse, search, and display detailed electronic product information.
- Responsive interface: Accessible on multiple devices through a modern and adaptable design.
- Database integration: Persistent storage of product, user, and transaction data using MongoDB.
- Scalable backend: Built with Express for handling routes and API requests efficiently.

This project demonstrates practical application of web development technologies in a real-world retail context, showcasing both collaborative teamwork and technical implementation.
